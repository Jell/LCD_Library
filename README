* Arduino LCD_Library

This is a Library for sparkfun's Nokia LCD screen shield for Arduino (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9363#comment_43350).

This is based on the work of Peter Davenport (http://peterdavenport.posterous.com/pages/prodjects).

This Driver only works for the PHILLIPS controller (for now), if your shield has an EPSON controller, then go with Peter's driver.

Feel free to fork and improve!
